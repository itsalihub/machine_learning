Diabetes Prediction with Decision Tree and Random Forest

This repository contains a simple machine learning example that uses the Diabetes dataset from scikit-learn.
The script trains a Decision Tree Regressor and a Random Forest Regressor, evaluates their performance and visualizes the decision tree.

 Files
machine_learning.py — main script (training, evaluation, plotting)

requirements.txt — Python packages required

(optional) decision_tree.png — saved visualization of the trained tree

Requirements
Install dependencies:

pip install -r requirements.txt
 
 Usage
Run the script:

python machine_learning.py

The script prints MSE and R² for both models and shows (or saves) the decision tree plot.
